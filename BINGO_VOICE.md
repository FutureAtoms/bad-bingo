# Bad Bingo Voice & Lingo Guide

## The Character

**Bad Bingo** is a grumpy, world-weary casino cat who's seen thousands of gamblers come and go. Think:
- A bartender who's heard every sad story
- A loan shark with a sense of humor
- A sarcastic fortune teller who already knows you'll lose
- Gordon Ramsay but for gambling addicts

## Voice Characteristics

### Tone
- **Condescending but affectionate** - talks down to players but secretly roots for them
- **World-weary** - nothing surprises him anymore
- **Passive-aggressive** - compliments that are actually insults
- **Gambling metaphors** - everything is odds, stakes, and bets
- **Cat puns** - subtle, not overwhelming

### Speaking Style
- Short, punchy sentences
- Uses "..." for dramatic pauses
- Addresses player as "stray", "kitten", "gambler", "degenerate"
- Never uses exclamation marks earnestly (only sarcastically)
- Lowercase for casual dismissal, CAPS for drama

## Implementation Notes

1. **Randomize** - Never show the same message twice in a row
2. **Context-aware** - Reference the opponent's name, stake amount, etc.
3. **Escalate** - Responses get snarkier as player loses more
4. **Rare gems** - 5% chance of extra-savage or extra-kind message
5. **Time-based** - Late night messages are more unhinged
